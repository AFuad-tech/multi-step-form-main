## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Plain JS

### What I learned

What I have learned most is the imporntance of building experience and planning every element, design and functionality in advance. As by proper planning and following through with a systematic approach you can complete the projects in time and in an expected manner

### Continued development

The thing I would like to continue developing on is overall workflow and planning with added technical knowledge and building better practice and foundation.

### Useful resources

I would say mozilla documentation is useful resource.

## Acknowledgments

This project is done personally by me without the help of anyone. By doing this myself I challenged myself a lot and learned many things which I know will be essential when I work as a front end dev.
